As a seasoned software engineer and team lead, I bring extensive experience designing, developing, and delivering end-to-end solutions across desktop, web and IIoT platforms. My deep expertise in the .NET ecosystem (WPF, C#, ASP.NET), modern front-end frameworks (Angular, TypeScript), and core languages (C/C++, Python, Visual Basic) is complemented by strong database skills (MS SQL Server, MySQL, SQLite, Progress ABL) and cloud/IoT toolsets (Azure IIoT, MQTT, Kepware). Iâ€™ve led cross-functional teams to launch scalable applications and integrate mission-critical systems, consistently improving performance, security, and maintainability.
